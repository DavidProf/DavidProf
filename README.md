Some prefix that I am using for my projects (not allways):

- `samples-` for concepts samples, like multi tasks code, "ideal" logging
- `boilerplate-` for boilerplates, just some simple structure with packages most of time
- `study-` things that I did for some course, tutorial or similar things
- `ni-` for projects that I did at some point but I'm not interested anymore
- those without prefix are forks or "real" projects, but most of my projects are planned to be in https://github.com/Xarlyu
